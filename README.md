## Download files

You first need to download the data file of the year you want analysed from :
https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/demandes-de-valeurs-foncieres/

You should rename the file to `valeursfoncieres_{yyyy}.csv` where `yyyy` is the year you want analysed.

You will also have to set the variable `year` in the second cell of the notebook to match the year of the file you downloaded.
